# 📚 Vue Book Wishlist

This is a practice project built with **Vue.js** as part of my learning journey at the **Information Technology Institute (ITI)**.

The app simulates a simple book wishlist system with the following main features:

## 🚀 Features

- A **navbar** with:
  - **Projects** and **Wishlist** links (anchors).
  - A **badge** showing the number of books added to the wishlist.

- A **Products section**:
  - Displays books in a **grid of cards**.
  - Each card includes book information and a button to add to the wishlist.

- A **Wishlist section**:
  - Shows added books in a **table format**.
  - Allows users to view all selected books.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Vue.js (Options API / Composition API — depending on what you used)
- HTML & CSS
- Bootstrap 

## 📖 Learning Goals

- ✅ Implement dynamic UI updates
- ✅ Handle user interaction and list rendering
- ✅ Basic responsive layout using CSS for better viewing on different screen sizes.
